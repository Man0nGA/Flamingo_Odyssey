# Projet Transverse
This was made in the prospect to the presented as a group project for Efrei.
not to boast, but it's a pretty nice game.

# How to Launch
To launch the game, simply go to the file "mainmenu_test.py" and launch it.

# more importantly, How to play ?
At all time during the game, pressing "k" will quit, to the menu if in a level, and back to desktop if on the menu.

On the Main Menu :
    Use your mouse to choose a planet. Unlocked planet will have a white outline when hovering over it.
    To launch the level, click on the planet.

In a Level:
    press on the right mouse button to make the arrow appear.
    The arrow shows in which direction the Flammingo will go, and will always aim towards your mouse cursor.
    To sling yourself, simply release the right mouse button.
    To restart, in case of being softlocked or just wanting to replay the amazingly crafted levels, press the "r" key (r like retry)
